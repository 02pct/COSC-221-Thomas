Hello! My name is Peyton Thomas and I am currently a senior undergraduate math major taking COSC 221 at Coppin State University taught by Dr. Ronak Nouri. The follow is my description about the simple project I uploaded and how to run it. 

The project file titled "test-projects" is a java project that cotains one file by the same name. The file itself is a program that takes the user input and outputs the day of the week corresponding to the days of the week of the Gregorian calendar. The user input is an integer, then the integer goes into the switch decision statement that is divides into cases based on the day of the week, then it output the corresponding day of the week. 

If you want to run/open the project follow these instructions. You first download the file named "test-projects" in the repository. Then, make sure you save the file in a place that is accessible by the IDE/coding platorm you are running, and the device you are on. Launch the application you use to program (I use an IDE), then click on the option on your application that allows you to open any project. After that, locate the project file you downloaded, and locate the .java file by the same name through the files, the file path you should follow is \test-projects\src\main\java\p\test\projects\TestProjects.java to locate the file. After you have located the .java file, double click to launch the file and run the program.

If you have any questions or come up with errors please let me know. 

Peyton Thomas
